    heading   : Our Vision
    content   : >
      We believe that digital twin technology will be a key part of the solutions for; green energy (e.g. via advanced asset management of offshore wind farms); healthcare (e.g. via personalised medicine); smart cities (e.g. by smart management of energy consumption); more efficient manufacturing (e.g by reducing costs and increasing time efficiency) to name just a few key applications. The Digital Twin Research Hub @Sheffield brings together key research teams to deliver this vision.
