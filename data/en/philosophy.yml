subtitle  : We aim to bring together research teams at the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and University of Sheffield working on digital twin related research for high-value engineering applications. At a societal level, Digital Twins (DTs) will be a key part of solutions for; green energy (e.g. asset management of offshore wind farms; healthcare (e.g. personalised medicine); smart cities (e.g. managing energy consumption); more efficient manufacturing (e.g by reducing costs and increasing time efficiency) to name some key applications. 
Digital Twins are radically reshaping most aspects of modern technology. A key objective of a DT is that it can faithfully capture time-evolutionary behaviour of the physical twin. Significant value and advantage can then be obtained by monitoring data and anticipating changes that happen over time, e.g. for asset management, scheduling of operation and maintenance, extending operational life and increasing security and resilience, to mention just a few tasks.  At present, there is only a very rudimentary understanding of how the time-evolution of a DT will work. Understanding more completely the dynamics and control of the twin across a range of time scales is the central research question of this proposal. More specifically, it will focus on high-value engineering applications from aerospace to civil infrastructure.

    content   : >
      We believe that digital twin technology will be a key part of the solutions for; green energy (e.g. via advanced asset management of offshore wind farms); healthcare (e.g. via personalised medicine); smart cities (e.g. by smart management of energy consumption); more efficient manufacturing (e.g by reducing costs and increasing time efficiency) to name just a few key applications. The Digital Twin Research Hub @Sheffield brings together key research teams to deliver this vision.
