  - title    : "Dataset: Human-Robot Video Data from a Manufacturing Factory"
    authors  :
      - Department of Computer Science. â€¢	This dataset, collected from an industrial partner, includes videos from a collaborative robotic manufacturing process (including normal working operations, participation of multiple operators, and potentially risky human-robot interactions). The videos can be used for reproducible research - particularly for image classification, segmentation, monitoring and decision making within digital twins and for automated safety analysis.

  - title    : "Annotation tool"
    authors  :
      - Department of Computer Science. This semi-automated annotation tool, integrated with deep learning, has been developed to support labelling of video and image data (and specifically for the above dataset).
