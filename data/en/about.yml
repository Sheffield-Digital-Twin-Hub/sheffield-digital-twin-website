      We are creating digital twin operational platforms, and connecting them to a range of demonstration examples. The operational platforms connect users, via a web-based interface with the physical twin, and cloud-based services such as data storage and high-power computation.

    description : >
      Physical twins need sensors and actuators connected to data acquisition hardware in order to interact with a digital twin. As a result, a digital twin implementation is reliant on this type of internet-of-things (IoT) hardware. We consider a digital twin to be made up of three layers: (1) IoT, (2) Operational Platform, and (3) Cloud services.
